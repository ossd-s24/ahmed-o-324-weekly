## Student Presentations
Presentations this week were really cool! Student had exceptional project choices, and regardless of whether they were able to merge their PR's or not, their efforts to contribute far outweigh anything else. The presentations themselves were smooth, well rehearsed, and inspiring. I also felt better after seeing that many of the other groups struggled witht he same things that our group did, as I before assumed with no evidence that they were all light years ahead in progress. 


## Final Touches
On Sunday we met to discuss final preparations for our presentation on Monday, and that meeting was overall effective in our ability to have a smooth presentation. Then Monday morning we met one final time for a final rehearsal. We went a bit over time on the practice run so that was valuable feedback as we were able to adapt the presentation to fit within the alloted time. Then, we presented! It was overall a wonderful and 10/10 course, and I leave with tons of value and relevant experience. Thank you Professor!
